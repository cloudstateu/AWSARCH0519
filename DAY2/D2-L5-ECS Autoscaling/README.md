## LAB Overview

#### This lab will demonstrate:

* Autoscaling ECS service 



## Task 1: Create an ECS Cluster

In this task you will create ECS Cluster.

1. In the AWS Management Console, on the **Services** menu, click **ECS**.
2. Click **Create Cluster**.

It this task you'll prepare a task definition for the service.

1. Click **Task definitions**.
2. Click **Create new Task Definition**.
3. Choose "EC2" and click **Next step**.
4. Enter a name for your task definition, e.g. "Student-X-TaskDefinition"
5. In the "Task size" area enter 256 for "Task memory" and 256 for "Task CPU".
6. Click **Add container**.
7. Enter a name for your container, e.g. "Student-X-Container".
8. Paste "jfusterm/stress:latest" as the "Image". 
9. Set "Memory Limits" to "Soft limit" and 128.
10. In the "ENVIRONMENT" area set Command to "--cpu, 8". Do not copy/paste quotation marks.

5. As a "Launch type" select "EC2".
6. Set your task definition.
7. Select your cluster.
8. Enter a name for the service, e.g. "Student-X-Service".
9. Set "service type" to "Replica".
10. Set "Number of tasks" to 2.

17. Click **View Service**.

Now you should have two instances of the task running.



## Task 4: Turning on Auto Scaling

In this task, you will set up the auto scaling for the service.


1. Click **Clusters**.
2. Find your cluster and click on its name.
3. Select **Services**.
4. Find your service and click on its name.
5. Click **Update**.
6. Click **Next step**.
7. Click **Next step**.
8. On the "Service Auto Scaling" part set "Service Auto Scaling" to "Configure Service Auto Scaling to adjust your serviceâ€™s desired count".

10. Set "Desired number of tasks" to 2.
11. Set "Maximum number of tasks" to 12.
12. Click **Add scaling policy**.
13. Set "Scaling policy type" to "Step scaling".
14. Enter a name for the policy, e.g. "Student-X-ScaleOut-Policy".
15. Select "Create new alarm".
16. Enter a name for the alarm, e.g. "Student-X-ScaleOut-Alarm".
17. Select "CPU Utilization" for "ECS service metric".
18. Set "Alarm threshold" to "Average" of CPUUtilization ">=" and value to 40 for 1 consecutove period of "5 minutes". 
19. Set "Scaling action" to "Add" 6 tasks.
20. Click **Save**.
21. Click **Save**.
22. Click **Next step**.

After several minutes there should be 7 tasks running on your cluster. Check "Desired count", it should be set to 8 tasks.

26. Click **your cluster name**.
27. Click **Metrics** and look at "CpuUtilization".



## Task 5: Adding EC2 instance to the cluster
